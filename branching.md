    # How to work with your named branch
    
    Open Visual Studio Code.
    Click on the "Explorer" icon on the left-hand side of the window.
    Click on the "Clone Repository" button.
    Enter the URL of the Git repository that contains the branch you created, and click "Clone".
    Once the repository has been cloned, click on the "Source Control" icon on the left-hand side of the window.
    Click on the "Branches" button, and select the branch you created from the list of branches.
    Visual Studio Code will automatically switch to the selected branch, and you can start working on it.
    
    Don't forget to push/commit your code regularly.
