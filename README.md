Jupyter Notebook Test: Music Dataset Analysis

In this test, you will be working with a dataset called "music.csv". This dataset contains information about 20 songs, including the song name, artist, album, release date, and duration in seconds.

Your task is to use pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to perform some basic data analysis on the "music.csv" dataset, and answer the following questions:

    What are the top 5 longest songs in the dataset? Print a table that shows the song name, artist, album, release date, and duration of each song.

    What is the average duration of a song in the dataset? Round your answer to the nearest second.

    How many songs were released before 2010? How many were released in or after 2010? Create a pie chart that shows the percentage of songs released before 2010 and the percentage of songs released in or after 2010.

    Create a scatter plot that shows the relationship between the duration of a song and the year it was released. Label the x-axis "Year" and the y-axis "Duration (seconds)".

You can use any additional pandas, numpy, or matplotlib functions to help you answer these questions. Your code should be well-commented and easy to understand.
Instructions:

    Download the "music.csv" dataset and save it to your Jupyter Notebook directory.

    Create a new Jupyter Notebook and import pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.

    Read in the "music.csv" dataset using pandas.

    Write your code to answer each of the four questions above
